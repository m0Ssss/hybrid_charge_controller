# hybrid_charge_controller development board version 1 and (energy meadow) version 2 
Low voltage solar/wind hybrid charge controller -  power conditioning circuit development board, and version 2 
MPPT and 0v charging
0.3v - 30 volt in AC or DC 
5v Out
Temperature sensor for over and under temperature protection
still a lot of issues need to e resolved. e.g. wrong placement of load in relation to charge protection IC (BQ2980), footprint wrong for SPV1040... list goes on haha. But it's ok I think for the first 2 PCBs I designed. 
Designed as part of the Windternet Project
