# hybrid_charge_controller development board version 1 and (energy meadow) version 2 
Low voltage solar/wind hybrid charge controller -  power conditioning circuit development board, and version 2 with built in charger. 
<br>MPPT and 0v charging
<br>0.3v - 30 volt in AC or DC 
<br>5v Out
<br>Temperature sensor for over and under temperature protection
<br>still a lot of issues need to e resolved. e.g. wrong placement of load in relation to charge protection IC (BQ2980), footprint wrong for SPV1040... etc.
